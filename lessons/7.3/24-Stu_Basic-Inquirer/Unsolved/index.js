/*
Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes in input from the user and logs a message with a selected color to the console.

Acceptance Criteria
It's done when I have initialized my repository with a package.json file by running npm init -y.
It's done when I set the "type" property to "module" in my package.json to allow for ESM style imports.
It's done when I have installed inquirer added it to my list of dependencies by running npm i inquirer.
It's done when I have installed colors and added it to my list of dependencies by running npm i colors.
It's done when the application asks the user, "What text would you like to log?".
It's done when the application asks the user, "What color would you like to use?", and has the options "red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "cyan", and "magenta".
It's done when the text is logged in the selected color.

üí° Hints
Use the inquirer npm page to see how to use lists and inputs.

üèÜ Bonus
Q: How could you also add some styling choices to the text logged using colors and inquirer?
A: TODO
