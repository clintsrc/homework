/*
Work with a partner to implement the following user story:
As a developer, I want to initialize my project and create a package.json file.
As a developer, I want to use ESM style imports in my project.
As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project.
As a developer, I want to install and use the colors npm package.

Acceptance Criteria
It's done when I see a package.json file created.
It's done when I set the "type" property to "module" in my package.json to allow for ESM style imports.
It's done when I have installed the colors package successfully and see it listed in the package.json file.
It's done when I type node index.js Sally 500 and the following is logged, with Sally highlighted with a bright yellow background and 500 highlighted with a bright green background, since the profit is a number greater than 0:
      My name is Sally and I made 500 dollars this quarter.
It's done when I type node index.js Bob -300 and the following is logged with Bob highlighted with a bright yellow background and -300 highlighted with a bright red background since the profit is a number less than or equal to 0:
My name is Bob and I made -300 dollars this quarter.

üìù Notes
Refer to the documentation:
   colors
Note: In the documentation, there will be two ways to use the colors package. We will be using the option that does not extend the String prototype. We will learn more about prototypes later.

üí° Hints
Remember that we can access command line arguments using process.argv.

üèÜ Bonus
Q: What is a String prototype?
A: TODO
