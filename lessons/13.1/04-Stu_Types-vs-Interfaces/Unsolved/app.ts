// TODO: What is wrong with the following code? How would you correct it?

type Coordinate = {
  x: number;
}

type Coordinate = {
  y: number;
}

const coordinate1: Coordinate = {
  x: 100,
  y: 200
};

console.log(coordinate1);


// TODO: Explain the following code throughout. What is the difference between the `fullName` and `teamMember` objects?

interface FullName {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

const fullName: FullName = {
  firstName: 'First',
  lastName: 'Last',
};

class TeamMember implements FullName {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  teamName: string;

}

const teamMember: TeamMember = {
