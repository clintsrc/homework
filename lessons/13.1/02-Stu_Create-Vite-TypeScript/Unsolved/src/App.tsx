üìê Create a TypeScript React App
Before We Begin
As we learned in the last module, initializing a React application using npm create vite@4.4.1 is fast and simple. This time, we'll use TypeScript instead of JavaScript as the "variant" (i.e. programming language).

Instructions
To create a new TypeScript React application, use the following steps:

In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run npm create vite@4.4.1.

üîë Note: This command will automatically create a subfolder to house your React application; you don't need to perform a mkdir command to create one manually.
Enter the desired name of your new project folder.

From the first list of options, select your framework for our activities in class. As before, we'll be using React.

From the second list of options, select your variant for our activities in class. This time, we'll be using TypeScript.

cd into your newly created project folder and run npm install.

Run npm run dev and navigate to the provided URL to see your application running.

Separate your application's Counter functionality into its own component as follows:

Replace the App.tsx in your application with the file ./Unsolved/src/App.tsx.

Copy the folder ./Unsolved/src/components into your src folder.

Rerun the command npm run dev and navigate to the provided URL to see that your application is now running using a Counter component.

üìù Notes
Refer to the documentation:
