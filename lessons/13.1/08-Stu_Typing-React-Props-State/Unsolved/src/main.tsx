/*
 * üìñ Implement TypeScript React Properties and State
 * As a developer, I want to implement component properties and state into my TypeScript React application.
 * 
 * Acceptance Criteria
 * It's done when the application displays two different Advertisement components, 
 * each with the fields companyName, productDescription, and price.
 * 
 * It's done when the Calculator component "Add" button correctly updates the 
 * displayed fields for total and previousTotal.
 * 
 * Use the "TODO" comments in the following files to guide your implementation:
 * 
 * ./Unsolved/src/components/Calculator.tsx
 * ./Unsolved/src/components/Advertisement.tsx
 * ./Unsolved/src/App.tsx
 * 
 * üí° Hints
 * What are two different ways to define types for React properties and state?
 * 
 * üèÜ Bonus
 * Q: How could we make some React component properties optional?
 * A: TODO
 *
