Q: What do the following naming conventions mean and how are they used in
    Python for the following examples?
    A single leading underscore, _radius.
    A single trailing underscore, class_.
    A double leading underscore, __radius.
    A double leading and trailing underscore, __name__,

A:
    Single leading underscore (_radius):
        This is a convention indicating that the attribute or method is
        intended for internal use within a class or module. Itâ€™s a weak
        internal use indicator and doesn't prevent external access, but
        signals that the item is not part of the public API.
    Single trailing underscore (class_):
        This is used to avoid conflicts with Python keywords or built-in
        names. For example, class_ is used to avoid conflict with the reserved
        keyword class.
    Double leading underscore (__radius):
        This triggers name mangling, where the name of the attribute is
        altered to include the class name (e.g., _ClassName__radius). This is
        used to avoid accidental name clashes in subclasses and is intended to
        make the attribute private.
    Double leading and trailing underscore (name):
        These are "special" or "magic" methods and attributes in Python, like
        __init__, __str__, and __name__. They are used by Python internally
        and follow a specific naming pattern. Users should generally avoid
        naming their attributes with this pattern to prevent conflicts with
        Python's internal methods.
