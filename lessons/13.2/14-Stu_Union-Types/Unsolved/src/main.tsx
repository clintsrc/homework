/*
🏗️ Display Last Digit, Character, or Array Element
Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

As a website visitor, I want the page to render the rightmost value of a word, number, or list of values, so that I can easily find them.
Acceptance Criteria
It's done when all of the corresponding values have the rightmost value of the array, string, or number displayed.

It's done when I have written a function using union types to properly handle all cases.

💡 Hints
How could we use the remainder operator to find the last digit of a number?

🏆 Bonus
If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

How do union types relate to tuples and enums?
