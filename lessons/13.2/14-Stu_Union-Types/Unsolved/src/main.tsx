/*
 * 🏗️ Display Last Digit, Character, or Array Element*
 * As a website visitor, I want the page to render the rightmost value of a
 * word, number, or list of values, so that I can easily find them.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria
 * - It's done when all of the corresponding values have the rightmost value of the
 *    array, string, or number displayed.
 * - It's done when I have written a function using union types to properly handle
 *    all cases.
 *
 * 💡 Hints
 * How could we use the remainder operator to find the last digit of a number?
 *
 * 🏆 Bonus
 * Q: How do union types relate to tuples and enums?
 * A: TODO
