 * üí° Hints
 * Which React built-in interface can you use to ensure that you're passing valid CSS
 * to your style props?
 *
 * üèÜ Bonus
 * Q: What is the csstype package, and how does it relate to the
 *    React.CSSProperties type?
 * A: The csstype package is a TypeScript library that provides type definitions for 
 *    CSS properties. It allows developers to use CSS property names and values in a 
 *    type-safe manner when working with inline styles in React components.
 * 
 *    The React.CSSProperties type is an interface provided by React that represents 
 *    the style properties for a component. It uses the types defined in the csstype 
 *    package to ensure that the styles applied to a React component are valid CSS 
 *    properties.
 *    
 *    In summary, the csstype package enhances the type safety of CSS properties in 
 *    TypeScript, and React.CSSProperties leverages this package to provide a robust 
 *    typing system for inline styles in React components. This helps prevent errors 
 *    and improves the developer experience when styling components.
